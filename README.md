**No cruft. No bloat. No dependencies.**

**Common Utilities** is an ecosystem of simple utility JavaScript functions for everyday development. 

### Hello! 🙌

**This project is built to provide JavaScript utility functions that are:**

* Easy to use 😌
* Simple 👌
* Tested ✅
* Typed \(using Typescript\) 📝
* Example containing 📚
* Collaborative 🎳

Just because this repository is currently under [**@yowainwright**](https://github.com/yowainwright) ****on Github. It can be moved to a **Github org** if others get involved! Please give **Common Utilities** a [**star on Github**](https://github.com/yowainwright/common-utilities), share, or give feedback if the documentation or packages themselves help you or need improvement!

### Why? 🤔

Often engineers write simple functions to do simple things. There is always an option to reach for a heavier tool to do something like a **deep merge**. However, often engineers can do something **simple** to satisfy their use-case.   
  
**Common Utilities** aims to provide functions for the **simple** use-case described above but with **types** and **tests**. This means engineers can use a smaller function from Common Utilities that looks much like something they would write quickly but not need to write tests or types because Common Utilities provides those things. Inversely, using a utility function from Common Utilities adds very little extra bloat for each utility used. 

### Common Utilities 🧰

**No cruft. No bloat. No dependencies.**

Simple, typed, functional, documented, and tested javascript utility functions.
